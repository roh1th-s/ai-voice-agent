# AI Voice Agent

An automatic AI voice agent designed to respond to calls during natural disaster emergencies. It makes essential inquiries and creates a report to be used for rescue efforts. Built to integrate with [daily.co](https://daily.co/)'s WebRTC platform for quick prototyping. Real time conversations achieved using [pipecat.ai](https://www.pipecat.ai/).

Main code is in `bot.py`. `server.py` contains code for a web server through which the bot can be started.

This was made as part of a hackathon project. (Codefury 7.0 @ UVCE, Bangalore)
